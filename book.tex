\chapter{Integration}
The goal here is to integrate the area under $f(x)$ from when $x = 0$ until we
reach $x = x_{end}$. What follows here is bunch of steps that shows my thinking
process because \emph{shadowdaemon} asked for it (and also because I am happy now).

\section{Areas of Lots of Extremely Tiny Rectangular Columns}
So to integrate $f(x) = x^2$ we have to keep summing extremely skinny
columns\footnote{\textbf{Note:} \emph{fefelix} of
\emph{freenode/\#gentoo-chat-exile} tried to look smart by attacking my rigor
by saying that the term \emph{skinny columns} is wrong and that it must be
replaced by the term \emph{infinitesimal} (facepalm moment here). He also tried
to look even smarter by using the phrase \emph{In the realm of $\mathbb{R}$}.
Obviously, any half-assed mathematician knows that $\mathbb{R}$ has only a
single infinitesimal which is zero. Yep, zero bitch. So the term
\emph{infinitesimal} is absolutely wrong in this context, thus even worse than
\emph{skinny columns}. The only exception is if \emph{fefelix} wishes to live
in the 1600s.} of, each of width $d$.
\[\begin{split}
  (x+d-x)(x)^2 + \\
  (x+2d-(x+d))(x+d)^2 + \\
  (x+3d-(x+2d))(x+2d)^2 + \\
  (x+4d-(x+3d))(x+3d)^2 + \\
  (x+5d-(x+4d))(x+4d)^2 + \\
  (x+6d-(x+5d))(x+5d)^2 + \\
  %
  (x+7d-(x+6d))(x+6d)^2 + \\
  (x+8d-(x+7d))(x+7d)^2 + \\
  (x+9d-(x+8d))(x+8d)^2 + \\
  (x+10d-(x+9d))(x+9d)^2 + \\
  (x+11d-(x+10d))(x+10d)^2 + \\
  \ldots
\end{split}\]



You see, if $d$ is extremely tiny (near zero), then we will have to sum an
infinite number of those tiny skinny areas. But for simplicity I put $\ldots$
instead.

We can simplify things:
\[\begin{split}
  d(x)^2 + \\
  d(x+d)^2 + \\
  d(x+2d)^2 + \\
  d(x+3d)^2 + \\
  d(x+4d)^2 + \\
  d(x+5d)^2 + \\
  %
  d(x+6d)^2 + \\
  d(x+7d)^2 + \\
  d(x+8d)^2 + \\
  d(x+9d)^2 + \\
  d(x+10d)^2 + \\
  \ldots
\end{split}\]

Let's expand those squares:
\[\begin{split}
  d(x)(x) + \\
  d(x+d)(x+d) + \\
  d(x+2d)(x+2d) + \\
  d(x+3d)(x+3d) + \\
  d(x+4d)(x+4d) + \\
  d(x+5d)(x+5d) + \\
  %
  d(x+6d)(x+6d) + \\
  d(x+7d)(x+7d) + \\
  d(x+8d)(x+8d) + \\
  d(x+9d)(x+9d) + \\
  d(x+10d)(x+10d) + \\
  \ldots
\end{split}\]

Let's multiply them square bitches:
\[\begin{split}
  dx^2 + \\
  d(x^2 + 2dx + d^2) + \\
  d(x^2 + 4dx + 4d^2) + \\
  d(x^2 + 6dx + 9d^2) + \\
  d(x^2 + 8dx + 16d^2) + \\
  d(x^2 + 10dx + 25x^2) + \\
  %
  d(x^2+12dx   +36d^2) + \\
  d(x^2+14dx   +49d^2) + \\
  d(x^2+16dx   +64d^2) + \\
  d(x^2+18dx   +81d^2) + \\
  d(x^2+20dx   +100d^2) + \\
  \ldots
\end{split}\]


Let's now multiply those bitches with $d$ so that the shit gets spread even
more:
\[\begin{split}
  dx^2 + \\
  dx^2 + 2d^2x + d^3 + \\
  dx^2 + 4d^2x + 4d^3 + \\
  dx^2 + 6d^2x + 9d^3 + \\
  dx^2 + 8d^2x + 16d^3 + \\
  dx^2 + 10d^2x + 25x^3 + \\
  %
  dx^2+12d^2x   +36d^3 + \\
  dx^2+14d^2x   +49d^3 + \\
  dx^2+16d^2x   +64d^3 + \\
  dx^2+18d^2x   +81d^3 + \\
  dx^2+20d^2x   +100d^3 + \\
  \ldots
\end{split}\]

\section{Approximating the Area}
Now this is a critical point. Below is basically saying that each row is an
approximation for the area under $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ till $x = x_{end}$. So the
$1^{st}$ one is a shit approximation where were approximate the area under that
curve by only one big fat column; so $d$ is so huge here, in fact $d =
x_{end}$.

Then, the 2nd line show a slightly less shit approximation where we approximate
the area under the curve by two fat ass rectangular columns. So here $d =
\frac{x_{end}}{2}$.

So the approximation of the area under the curve gets more and more accurate in
each line.
\[\begin{split}
  dx^2\\
  2dx^2 + 2d^2x + d^3\\
  3dx^2 + 6d^2x + 5d^3\\
  4dx^2 + 12d^2x + 14d^3\\
  5dx^2 + 20d^2x + 30d^3\\
  6dx^2 + 30d^2x + 55d^3\\
  7dx^2 + 42d^2x + 91d^3\\
  8dx^2 + 56d^2x + 140d^3\\
  9dx^2 + 72d^2x + 204d^3\\
  10dx^2 + 90d^2x + 285d^3\\
  11dx^2 + 110d^2x + 385d^3\\
  %dx^2 + 2d^2x + d^3\\
  %dx^2 + 4d^2x + 4d^3\\
  %dx^2 + 6d^2x + 9d^3\\
  %dx^2 + 8d^2x + 16d^3\\
  %dx^2 + 10d^2x + 25x^3\\
  %
  %dx^2+12d^2x   +36d^3 + \\
  %dx^2+14d^2x   +49d^3 + \\
  %dx^2+16d^2x   +64d^3 + \\
  %dx^2+18d^2x   +81d^3 + \\
  %dx^2+20d^2x   +100d^3 + \\
\end{split}\]

So basically, you see there is a pattern. The coefficient of the $1^{st}$ term
is easy peasy (just incrementing from 1 to $\infty$). The coefficient from the
$2^{nd}$ term is kinda interesting, it follows the equation $(i^2+i)$ where $i$
is the line number. Note that we start counting lines from 0. So the $1^{st}$
has $i = 0$ and the $2^{nd}$ line has $i = 1$, etc. Finally, the last term is
kinda cool, it follows the pattern $\frac{(i^2+i)(2i+1)}{6}$.

Now you may ask, how did I find these patterns? Well these are well known
number series. You can look them up in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer
Sequences\footnote{http://oeis.org/}.

So, the area under the curve of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ up to $x_{end}$, by any
$d$ (and its corresponding $i$) is:
\[\begin{split}
  dx^2  +  (i^2+i)d^2x   +  \frac{(i^2+i)(2i+1)}{6}d^3\\
\end{split}\]

Now we are almost done. We know that $x = 0$, so we can cancel a few terms:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dick}\begin{split}
  d0^2  +  (i^2+i)d^20   +  \frac{(i^2+i)(2i+1)}{6}d^3\\
  \frac{(i^2+i)(2i+1)}{6}d^3\\
\end{split}\end{equation}

Of course, we could've canceled those terms that multiply against zero earlier,
but I didn't for random reasons. I just didn't. That's the randomness of life.
But it's all mathematically correct as my caveman balls tell.

You can code a simple script that you give it $x_{end}$ and $d$, by which it
automatically finds $i = x_{end}/d$. You will notice that as $d$ gets smaller,
you end up approaching some limit after which reduction in $d$ does not cause
any change in the estimated area under the curve.

\section{The Precise Area Under The Bitch}
Now let's find the ultimate precision in the limit as $i \rightarrow
\infty$ which also means that $d \rightarrow 0$. But how about not?
Cause it's too hard to solve the limit when two variables are
approaching different limits.

To simplify the limits in an easier way, let's represent $i$ in terms of $d$
and $x_{end}$ as follows $i = x_{end}/d$. Then the same equation would become
as follows:
\[\begin{split}
  \frac{((x_{end}/d)^2+(x_{end}/d))(2(x_{end}/d)+1)}{6}d^3\\
  \frac{(\frac{x_{end}^2}{d^2}+\frac{x_{end}}{d})(\frac{2x_{end}}{d}+1)}{6}d^3\\
  \frac{(\frac{x_{end}^2}{d^2}+\frac{x_{end}}{d})(\frac{2x_{end}}{d}+1)}{6}d^3\\
  \frac{\frac{1}{d}(\frac{x_{end}^2}{d}+x_{end})(\frac{2x_{end}}{d}+1)}{6}d^3\\
  \frac{(\frac{x_{end}^2}{d}+x_{end})(\frac{2x_{end}}{d}+1)}{6}d^2\\
  \frac{\frac{2x_{end}^3}{d^2} +  \frac{x_{end}^2}{d} +  \frac{2x_{end}^2}{d} + x_{end}}{6}d^2\\
  \frac{\frac{2x_{end}^3d^2}{d^2} +  \frac{x_{end}^2d^2}{d} +  \frac{2x_{end}^2d^2}{d} + x_{end}d^2}{6}\\
  \frac{2x_{end}^3 +  x_{end}^2d +  2x_{end}^2d + x_{end}d^2}{6}\\
\end{split}\]

Now, it's super easy. We have to find the limit of that equation as a single
variable approaches 0 (we got rid of $i$). The equation becomes:
\[\begin{split}
  \frac{2x_{end}^3}{6}\\
  \frac{x_{end}^3}{3}\\
\end{split}\]

That's it. Integration re-invented bitch :) --- $\frac{x_{end}^2}3$.

Q.E. freaking DEE.


\chapter{Differentiation}
Here we want to find the slope of $f(x)$ at point $x$. This is easy so I won't
say much here.

Differentiate $x^2$.

$\frac{f(x+d) - f(x)}{x + d - x}$

$\frac{(x+d)^2 - x^2}{x + d - x}$

$\frac{(x+d)^2 - x^2}{d}$

$\frac{(x+d)(x+d) - x^2}{d}$

$\frac{x^2 + xd + xd + d^2 - x^2}{d}$

$\frac{x^2}{d} + \frac{2xd}{d} + \frac{d^2}{d} - \frac{x^2}{d}$

$\frac{x^2}{d} + 2x + d - \frac{x^2}{d}$

$2x + d$

Now, as $d \rightarrow \infty$, it becomes $2x$. Done.
